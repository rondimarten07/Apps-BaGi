# BaGi Apps

## About BaGi

BaGi, stands for Barang Guna Lagi, is an Android-based application designed for local (currently in Jakarta) sharing of used items. The app allows users to share pre-owned items such as shoes, bags, and clothes. BaGi incorporates machine learning technology to determine the suitability of items for uploading. If an item is deemed suitable, it can be uploaded to the application for others to claim and reuse. However, if an item is deemed unsuitable, it cannot be uploaded to the platform. BaGi promotes sustainability and encourages the local community to reduce waste by giving unused items a second chance through local sharing.<br>
